      <p>
        My entire 27-year career has been about having the compassion to show
        people their own power.

      <p>
        From nervous guests on my live TV show, or colleagues who wanted more
        in their lives, to CEOs confronted with challenging business situations,
        I have been there for them. They were in different scenarios, but they
        all needed the same thing - someone to listen, ask powerful questions,
        and ignite a fire they didnâ€™t know existed. I provide tactical guidance
        on how leaders can evolve the cultures in their companies, and their
        personal leadership styles play a big part in that.
